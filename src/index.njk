      <h1>Attention Developers of the Future</h1>
      <p>Like you and many of us across earth, I recognized I needed to find a way into tech recently. I begun to dive deep in the world of programming to earn a new skill almost two years ago. With this blog, my intentions are to inspire and motivate you along your journey by documenting my own. The benefits I recieve from building this blog site are identical. This site keeps me pushing to become a better developer.</p>
      <p>To start off slow, I have a few articles below for you to get a feel of my writing style. Thank for visiting and please enjoy.</p>
