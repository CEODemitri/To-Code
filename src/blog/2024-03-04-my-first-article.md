As I observe and listen, I notice the landscape of us new programmers have been tainted with the idea of inferority. It can be intimidating to enter the tech world and find your place. Most new coders are learning to program with the intent to find a new career and elevate their current lives. As the world keeps turning, technology seems to get more prominent by the day. How do you see yourself carving out your portion of the future?

Lately, I often find myself reminding me that I am not in competition with the current pace of technology. I forcibly stimulate my studies by imaging myself preparing for a job, as many of us. But in my heart, I feel something different. Almost every essence of my being only can accept the idea of me learning to code as platform to build my own business and career. Back to reality, I feel like I should at least try to care about having a job as a coder to justify my hours and days I pour my energy into coding. I would love to build a company myself with the ideas I have in mind. Then again, I also feel like I need a job to more adequately provide for my family at this moment. I could be lucky and find a way to provide for generations with my own company; chasing our currency is like running on a wheel. Like me, I am sure you can find many reasons to be motivated.

Back and forth. The obvious path: learn from a few companies and then grow my own. Along with keeping pace with the rate of technology, we continue to keep our eyes open and racing towards our destiny.
