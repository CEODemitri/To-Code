description: I started this adventure as A Challenge to myself to be something different. The path has been exciting and eye-opening. In my perspective, I feel like I am going pretty high speed. Still amazing How easy life may pass us by, moving even faster plus revealing new paradigms at every moment. What does our future hold in this turbelent era? One thing for sure, I will be an assest to the future society.

<!-- TODO 1: rewrite this blog and write complete at the bottom of the page-->
<!-- for the first blog, my idea is to get the ball rolling with this site. I have a few plans to implement. this first blog must set the foundation for this iteration of the site(even though it will be seen last when listed, more personal) -->
<!-- topic: in the beginning: as coders what is our motivation, what may we accomplish, the state of the coding community -->

Marching into the tech field can be extremely competitive and at the same time, or even more rewarding. Millions of people across the world have migrated to tech in hopes of staying relevant with the current times. Observing the landscape we call home, society seems to be immersed in technology with the stragglers quickly adapting and adopting newer, modern methods to best serve their supporters. So it seems only right to align your skills as so: leading an enormous influx of brand new coders into the tech market.

When I started my own journey, my spider senses never tingled concerning the number of new programmers and how many peers would arise. I noticed the incoming wave but no where near correct on measure of magnitude. Newbie Tech Communities, all over the world, have been growing and thriving for years even before my own migration. I started off thinking I was unique in my attempt to learn on my own and attempt to find a career. No research, I dived right in to fulfill my passion and dreams. Saying all that, even despite the multitudes of people, I have never thought of anyone as competition personally. We may be applying for the same job on the same day at the same time, completing our interview at the same time. We are not competing, in my perspective. No more then coincidence for me; what's necessary in this game of life for my path, for your own path, will find a way to happen. Comparable to the idea of fate. No matter the circumstances, I am happy for all of us and wish for all us to live the careers we wish and dream for.

To be honest, the act of coding has been greatly simplified due to many progressions. What will the role be for us newbies? Seems to occur monthly; a new aspect of tech surfaces, pushing to increase productivity and all sorts of excuses. What may we offer in this short period of time?
Progression is the only job of a human; we were not summoned here from nature to maintain, to advance and build from the predecessors is the way to go.
